# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The penguins dataset has 344 rows, 8 columns. The important variables
include species, island, bill length, flipper length, and body mass. The
mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.

``` r
library(ggplot2)

# Draw the scatterplot
ggplot(penguins, aes(
  x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Flipper Length vs Bill Length",
    x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Flipper Length (mm)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The plot above shows flipper length against bill length for penguins in
the dataset. Colored by species, the plot reveals three distinct
clusters. Penguins of the same species generally share similar bill and
flipper lengths: Adelies have the shortest, Chinstraps the longest
flippers, and Gentoos the longest bills. While the clusters are
well-defined, there is some variation within each, indicating
considerable individual differences. There also appears to be a positive
correlation between bill length and flipper length.

# Problem 2

Here we create is a data frame comprised of:  
a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution  
a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
than 0  
a character vector of length 10  
a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
set.seed(10) # Set a seed to ensure reproducible results

# Generate data and create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  logical_vector = rnorm(10) > 0,
  character_vector = as.character(1:10),
  factor_vector =  factor(rep(c("low", "medium", "high"), length.out = 10))
)
```

We can calculate the mean for numeric and logical variables (TRUE is
considered as 1 and FALSE is considered as 0), but we cannot calculate
the mean for character vectors and factor vectors.

``` r
mean_values <- df %>%
  summarise(
    random_sample_mean = mean(pull(df, random_sample), na.rm = TRUE),
    logical_vector_mean = mean(pull(df, logical_vector), na.rm = TRUE),
    character_vector_mean = NA, # Characters_vectors cannot be averaged
    factor_vector_mean = NA # Factor_vectors cannot be averaged
  )
```

Mean of the numeric variable is -0.4906568;  
Mean of the numeric variable is 0.7.

Next, we apply the as.numeric function to logical, character, and factor
variables

``` r
as.numeric(df$logical_vector) 
as.numeric(df$character_vector)
as.numeric(df$factor_vector)
```

As you can see, as.numeric:  
In logical vector, convert TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0;  
In character vector, convert characters that are valid numeric values to
their numeric form;  
In factor vectors, factor levels “low”, “medium”, “high” will be
converted to 1, 2, 3.
